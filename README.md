# Bluetooth-Soil-Tester-Device
Am working on a bluetooth soil tester device. This is a device which is used to check soil quality, that is :soil pH, soil microbial activities and soil moisture. The device has a bluetooth module which will be used to send soil quality data to an android application. The programming languages used are C++(might replace with a python) for the device and Java and XML for the android app.
The device has a gas sensor which will be used for detecting microbial activities because Soil microbes release CO2
It also has a soil moisture sensor to detect soil moisture content
It also has a pH sensor which will be used for checking Soil pH level
The device employs early detection measures to ensure good soil quality in the fields.
This is a portable device
Currently 60% done with the electronics part (Connections) and 90% done with the C++ code for the device, will now start working on the android part.
