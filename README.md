# Bluetooth-Soil-Tester-Device
Am working on a bluetooth soil tester device. This is a device which is used to check soil quality, that is :soil pH, soil microbial activities and soil moisture. The device has a bluetooth module which will be used to send soil quality data to an android application. The programming languages used are C++ for the device and Java and XML for the android app.
